// These two are the phases of javascrript work

// 1) Compilation Phase
// 2) Code Executin phase

//_________________________________________________

// The code written in JavaScript is not executed line by line rather it is first compiled and then executed... But in ES-6 Official documentation, it's not written that it must be compiled first... But in ES-6 it is mentioned that--->

// 1) Early Error checking of code
// 2) Determine appropriate scope for variables

// Code is compiled in Js due to these two phases


//______________________________________________________

// Compilation is done in three phases

// 1) Tokenizing/Lexing ---> Code is divided into small  tokens

// 2) Parsing---> Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) is made using small tokens

// 3) Code generation
